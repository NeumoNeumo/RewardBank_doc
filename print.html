<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Set up the expected Project-Entertainment Ratio(PER)</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <a href="guide/../reference/concepts.html#project">project</a> is a planned, time-constraint
event, usually linked to a note to record related information, for instance,
write a program, write a paper, etc.</p>
<p>Entertainment time is freer and easier in comparison with a project. What you can do
at entertainment involves reading novels, going to a concert, traveling for a week,
etc.</p>
<p>Your eating time, sleep time and those that you must do to support your life are
not implicated in your PER's consideration(but they are recorded in your <a href="guide/../reference/concepts.html">time
log</a>)</p>
<p>How much time you would like to spend on things that require long-term
persistence and efforts is up to you. And this tool is going to make an initial
setup based on your answer.</p>
<p>Suppose you sleep for 8 hours every day. Different PERs are listed below for
reference.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>PER</th><th>Project</th><th>Entertainment</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>1:1</td><td>8h</td><td>8h</td></tr>
<tr><td>2:1</td><td>10.7h</td><td>5.3h</td></tr>
<tr><td>3:1</td><td>12h</td><td>4h</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Add some events to log your time</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add two new types "Productivity" and "Improvement" to your time logger. <em>You are
expected to change/rename/subdivide these types to customize them for you.</em> Then
start with "Productivity" which is what you are doing right now.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Add your projects</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We suggest every project has a deadline if possible, to fight against
procrastination. In the project, you need to set how much time you are going to
devote into it every week and every day.</p>
<p>Then you are required to set milestones(for example 3 milestones) in the project
note. A project note is a note dedicated to record everything concerning
this project. You can utilize the link and backlink functionality in Obsidian to
associate more notes to it. These milestones also have their own deadlines. But
it is not necessarily to set all the deadlines at once because the deadline of the
next milestone may depend on your previous one.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Add your tasks</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>After your project is added, try to create a task associated with this
project/milestone.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Log your "improvement"</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Switch your time record from "Productivity" to "Improvement".</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Start a pomodoro</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Start a pomodoro and associate it with the project/milestone you added. Write
down what you expect at the end of this pomodoro in the dialog box and start
focusing on this task. Please avoid any interruption during this period. If
something comes across your mind, just scribble it down in the draft box or add
a new task in the <a href="guide/../features/quickadd.html">quick add</a> pane. Let's continue this
process by clicking the "fast forward" button. At the end of the pomodoro, you
are required to evaluate yourself giving a score between 0 to 100%. Then you
will earn some random coins based on the algorithm.</p>
<p>Our system would recommend another task based on your energy and the interest
score of all your tasks today. This is the only task you have added to the
system, so you have finished all your tasks today. You will get a bonus for this.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Add entertainments</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>strategy 1.</p>
<p>After working for a long time, you need some time to relax yourself. Based on
the types of different activities, you ought to play different prices for them.
Now it's time to add your first entertainment item. Fill in the blank and we would
calculate a recommended reward for you. For now, add an entertainment named
"read novels" with initial interest value 5 and set the price as 0 just for
demonstration. Add another entertainment named "go to cinema" with the initial
interest value 4 and set the price as 0 also for demonstration. <em>You are
expected to create your customized project/entertainment economy under the
guidance of our algorithm</em>.</p>
<p>Start your first entertainment "read novels" and click the "fast forward" button
to end it. Start your second entertainment "go to cinema" and and end it again.
A dialog box would pop up to prompt you to enter whether you prefer "read
novels" or "go to cinema". Choose "go to cinema" which contradicts with your
initially given interest values. Our <a href="guide/../reference/algorithms.html">algorithm</a>
would recommend another price for your entertainment and it is up to you to
accept or not.</p>
<p>Stategy 2.</p>
<p>The standard recommendation for the price is 1 coin for 1 hour. And you may
fluctuate it around 0.8-1.2 based on you preference. For example, surfing the
addictive social network is more stimulative to our neural systems compared to
read <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em> by Ernest Hemingway. But after scrolling the
smart phone screen for an hour, it only leaves us nihility and the impulse to
watch more memes, while what the novel that seems boring at the first glance
leaves us is a long-lasting spirit -- "a man can be destroyed but not defeated".
In such cases, assign a higher price for social networking and a lower for
novels might be a better choice.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="clock-in"><a class="header" href="#clock-in">Clock in</a></h1>
<p>This is the easiest way to get coins. While you cannot get a coin every day when
you clock in, there is still a probability that you get some coins. Moreover,
the achievement system guarentees that you can definitely get some coins after
unremitting clocking in for a period of time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="piggy-banks"><a class="header" href="#piggy-banks">Piggy Banks</a></h1>
<p>Piggy banks serve as designated repositories for saving coins with the purpose
of funding specific expenditures, such as a seven-day tour or an expensive
concert. By utilizing a piggy bank, individuals can earmark their coins for a
particular use, thereby minimizing the temptation to spend the saved money on
minor, trivial purchases. This approach helps ensure that sufficient funds are
accumulated for significant events or experiences.</p>

information.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="concepts"><a class="header" href="#concepts">Concepts</a></h1>
<p>There are many concepts in RewardBank and this page would walk you through them
quickly.</p>
<h2 id="project-entertainment-ratioper"><a class="header" href="#project-entertainment-ratioper">Project Entertainment Ratio(PER)</a></h2>
<p>This ratio is set by yourself. It is a measure of the work/day balance. You can
get coins from finishing your project and use your coins to buy some
entertainment. We add some randomness to the process to achieve the intermittent
random reward.</p>
<h2 id="task-management"><a class="header" href="#task-management">Task Management</a></h2>
<h3 id="project"><a class="header" href="#project">Project</a></h3>
<p>A project is a long-term event, possibly last for months. We recommend to set a
deadline for every project to resist procrastination. A ideal period for a
project is <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/toolkit-for-setting-achieving-goals">12-week
time</a>,
roughly a quarter.</p>
<h3 id="milestone"><a class="header" href="#milestone">Milestone</a></h3>
<p>Milestones are used as subgoals in your project to track your rate of process.
Milestones should preferably be quantitative, at least qualitative, to guarentee
a definite measurability. Milestones not only provide you the track of your
project, but also give you an impulse to continue and the observable hope to
finish a seemingly unattainable project.</p>
<h3 id="action"><a class="header" href="#action">Action</a></h3>
<p>Actions are what you actually do every day. They are the most fine-grained
schedule for your project. You add actions to your daily schedule and finish
them. A action is not necessarily associated with a milestone or a project. For
example, take the trash can be a action but it is not categorized in any
projects in common cases.</p>
<p>Every action has a value, <em>interest</em>, indicating how interesting you find this
action is. This value is used in our <a href="reference/../reference/algorithms.html#task-scheduling">task
scheduling</a>.</p>
<h2 id="time-management"><a class="header" href="#time-management">Time management</a></h2>
<h3 id="time-record"><a class="header" href="#time-record">Time Record</a></h3>
<p>Your time records track every moment of your day, including your sleep. It is not
necessarily to be tied with a specific project. For example, you never expect
your sleep as a project.😂</p>
<h3 id="pomodoro"><a class="header" href="#pomodoro">Pomodoro</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">The Pomodoro technique</a>
enjoys a good reputation for its effectiveness of narrowing your focus on a
concrete task in a given time period. During this period, you should be 100%
focused on the task on your hand. Nothing can interrupt you or you cannot
harvest a tomato at the end of this pomodoro. We have a <a href="reference/../features/quickadd.html">quick
add</a> for you to add a task or something else that
just comes across your mind. Write it down and go back to your original task.
Everytime you finish focusing for a time interval, you ought to evaluate your
performance during this period to assist you to have a better control of
yourself.</p>
<p>A pomodoro must be associated with a corresponding task (and a corresponding time
log because the logger is always tracking your time).</p>
<h2 id="reward-bank"><a class="header" href="#reward-bank">Reward Bank</a></h2>
<h3 id="coin"><a class="header" href="#coin">Coin</a></h3>
<p>Coins are "fiat currency" in the reward bank system. Based on coins, we
implement the random intermittent reward system to enhance your urge to pursuit
your goal and maintain a balance between projects and entertainment.</p>
<h4 id="income"><a class="header" href="#income">Income</a></h4>
<p>There are multiple ways you can earn coins.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="reference/../features/clockin.html">Clock in</a>.</li>
<li>Finish a <a href="reference/./concepts.html#task">task</a>.</li>
<li>Obtain a <a href="reference/./concepts.html#bonus">bonus</a>.</li>
<li><a href="reference/./concepts.html#achievement">Reach an achievements</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="expenditure"><a class="header" href="#expenditure">Expenditure</a></h4>
<p>You can exchange coins for the opportunities to get entertainment.</p>
<h3 id="entertainment"><a class="header" href="#entertainment">Entertainment</a></h3>
<p>Everything that is not in the list of projects and makes you happy is an
entertainment. It can be playing the piano, read novels. Every entertainment is
like a commodity in a shopping mall. The price is determined by yourself but we
have a <a href="reference/../reference/algorithms.html#price-recommendation">recommendation system</a>
to assist you to set and adjust the value.</p>
<h3 id="bonus"><a class="header" href="#bonus">Bonus</a></h3>
<p>We have a list of bonus for you to reduce your work friction -- for example, to
get into the state focusing on your work with less pain after a vacation or a
period when you have a low mood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." -- Franklin D. Roosevelt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you embark on the task itself, you would say, "well, it's easier than
expected". And bonuses are used to promote things like this stuff. The first
task you do every day would reward you a bonus.</p>
<h3 id="achievement"><a class="header" href="#achievement">Achievement</a></h3>
<p>Our system would reward your persistence. For example, <a href="reference/../features/clockin.html">clocking
in</a> for 100 days would unlock an achievement named
"100-day Legend" and give you a reward.</p>
<h3 id="lucky-chest"><a class="header" href="#lucky-chest">Lucky Chest</a></h3>
<p>This is a random reward that would appear occasionally anytime you are using
this plugin . You can disable this functionality or restrict when it can occur
if you do not want to be disrupted during a pomodoro.</p>

<h2 id="goal"><a class="header" href="#goal">Goal</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Make the ratio of the time spent on projects and entertainment fluctuated
around your set PER.</li>
<li>Make the interest value reflects your preference accurately.</li>
<li>Keep the user as motivated as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reward"><a class="header" href="#reward">Reward</a></h2>
<p>After harvesting a tomato, you are required to self-evaluate yourself between 0%
to 100% according to your performance in this pomodoro period. If you are not
sure how to conduct the evaluation, here are some beneficial questions that
might enlight you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the outcome up to your expectation when you start this pomodoro?</li>
<li>Are you fully immersed into this task?</li>
<li>What about your performance compared to the last time you did similar tasks?</li>
</ul>
<p>The coins you get from this pomodoro are calculated as</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">coins = (10 * period_h * (1 + (self_eval - 0.7) * 0.5 + epsilon * 0.1)) / PER;
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>period_h</code> represents how long this pomodoro is in unit of hours,
<code>self_eval</code> represents your self-evaluation score, <code>epsilon</code> is a random variable
of a truncated normal distribution between -2 and 2.</p>
<h2 id="price"><a class="header" href="#price">Price</a></h2>
<p>One coin corresponds to one hour of entertainment on average. But we have
multiple algorithms to adjust the price with the following thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The price is based on how much time this event costs. (Standard unit price)</li>
<li>If an entertainment is more appealing to you, it has a higher price. (Interest)</li>
<li>If an entertainment is recommended, it has a higher price. (Recommendation)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can switch to a different strategy but sometimes additional information are
required in another strategy. So you have to fill in some information collection
forms.</p>
<h3 id="fixed"><a class="header" href="#fixed">Fixed</a></h3>
<p>The edition of the price is all in your hand. We will not change it or give any
recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="zen-master"><a class="header" href="#zen-master">Zen Master</a></h3>
<p>This strategy is suitable for those freelances who have no holiday or, in other
words, have holidays everyday -- what day it is today is not in their mind.</p>
<p>If the recent frequency of your entertainment is higher than before, it would be
assigned a higher score. This strategy encourages you to have a stable
entertainment schedule.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">price = clamp(avg_interval / last_time_till_now, 0.6, 1.5)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="gradient-descent"><a class="header" href="#gradient-descent">Gradient Descent</a></h3>
<p>The initial price is set by the user. This strategy would reevaluate the price
of entertainments based on your interest and their value.</p>
<p>Suppose we have \(m\) types of entertainments with prices \(p_1, p_2, \cdots,
p_m\) , durations \(h_1, h_2, \cdots, h_m\), and normal frequencies \(f_1,
f_2, \cdots, f_m\). The normal frequency represents how often you buy this
entertainment in common cases. For instance, it can be \(1/1, 1/7, 1/30,
1/365\), representing daily, weekly, monthly and yearly respectively. The real
frequency is different from normal frequency, it is \(s_i f_i\) where
\(s_i\) is a ratio like \(0, 1.2, 1.5\). It is recommended that the ratio is
less than \(2\) so that our algorithm could work the best.</p>
<p>We connect \(s_i\) and \(p_i\) by the following formula:</p>
<p>\[s_ i = A(h_i/p_i + \mu_i - \sigma_i)\]</p>
<p>where the activation function \(A(x) = \text{max}\{ 0, \text{log}(1+x) \}\)
and \(\mu_i\) represents the interest value \(\sigma_i\) represents the
recommendation value. Using this relation and historical data, we can calculated
the \(\mu_i\). This interest value can be used to predict the change on
\(s_ i\) in the next period when the price varies.</p>
<p>\[s'_ i = A(h_i/p'_ i + \mu_i - \sigma_i)\]</p>
<p>where \(s'_ i\) are predicted ratios in the next period based on historical
data and \(p'_ i\) are the price in the next period.</p>
<p>We are going to optimize the following cost using gradient descent with a small
learning rate:</p>
<p>\[ \left(\sum_i s'_ i f_i p'_ i - \text{Income}\right)^2 + \left(\sum_i s'_ i
f_i h_i-\text{WorkingHour / PER}\right)^2 \]</p>
