# Piggy Banks

Piggy banks serve as designated repositories for saving coins with the purpose
of funding specific expenditures, such as a seven-day tour or an expensive
concert. By utilizing a piggy bank, individuals can earmark their coins for a
particular use, thereby minimizing the temptation to spend the saved money on
minor, trivial purchases. This approach helps ensure that sufficient funds are
accumulated for significant events or experiences.
